Happstack 0.2 Release Notes
================================================================================

  The WebT/ServerPartT change
  -------------------------------
  WebT and ServerPartT have been substantially refactored.  They are now built
  from simpler monads.  ServerPartT is now the only monad you have to deal
  with, most of the time.  I.e. you almost never have to look at WebT again.
  You just have do blocks in ServerPartT.  Inside ServerPartT you can get your
  request (askRq), modify your request (localRq), exit immediately
  (finishWith), exit failure (mzero), and alter your response filters
  (composeFilter, setFilter, getFilter) It also lifts ErrorT, ReaderT, WriterT
  and StateT, so you can embed one of those as well.  As a bonus, nearly all
  the functions you expected to take a WebT or to operate only within a WebT
  can now work inside a ServerPartT directly. The monad stack handles all the
  data threading.
  
  That being said, here are a list of the non-backwards compatible changes.
  ServerPartT, WebT, unServerPartT and unWebT now have different semantics.  To
  get existing code to compile you can change your methods like so:

    ServerPartT -> withRequest
    WebT -> mkWebT
    unServerPartT -> runServerPartT
    unWebT -> ununWebT or runWebT depending on what you're going for.

  By just making the above changes, your existing code should continue to work
  as before.  However, at this point, any old code you have can be greatly
  simplified.  For example, you will never have to use anyRequest or
  withRequest to change from ServerPartT to WebT.  You never have to interact
  with WebT directly.  You can do everything in a ServerPartT do block.  The
  examples provided in the documentation (especially basicAuth') just barely
  touch on the power of ServerPartT now.  Notice that basicAuth' mixes reading
  requests and altering responses all without exposing WebT, constructing a
  ServerPartT, or really doing any data threading at all.

  As a quick example:

  This:
    uriRest :: Monad m => (String -> ServerPartT m a) -> ServerPartT m a
    uriRest handle = withRequest $ \rq ->
                  unServerPartT (handle (rqURL rq)) rq

  Becomes this:
    uriRest :: (ServerMonad m, Monad m) => (String -> m a) -> m a
    uriRest handle = askRq >>= handle . rqURL

  Every single function that uses withRequest, anyRequest, unServerPartT,
  unWebT or ununWebT can be rewritten to take advantage of these simple monad
  behaviors.  Additionally, a lot of functions were added to make it easier to
  work entirely inside a do block.
  
    getHeaderM, addHeaderM, getData, getDataFn, escape', finishWith, getFilter,
    setFilter, composeFilter, applyFilter, setResponseCode, guardRq, methodM,
    methodOnly, nullDir, requireM

  The following were deprecated since they duplicate functionality
    
    noHandle -> Use mzero
    multi -> Use msum
    method -> you should be able to use methodSP though you'll need to fix
      your typing
    modifyResponse -> use composeFilter

  Also, this release sees the return of simpleHTTP', though not as you knew it
  before.  simpleHTTP must take a ServerPartT IO a.  simpleHTTP' lets you use
  Any ServerPartT m a, as long as you provide a function for unwrapping your
  interior monad into an IO monad.  This is particularly important since
  ServerPartT has lifting instances for WriterT, StateT, ErrorT, and ReaderT,
  thus embedding your favorite monad transformer into ServerPartT is easier
  than ever.

  Documentation
  -------------------------------
  This release also adds substantial documentation for the package
  Happstack.Server.SimpleHTTP which convers most of the new structures added,
  as well as many of your old favorites.  Be sure to check it out.

  Removing list types from SimpleHTTP
  -------------------------------
  Having most of the methods in SimpleHTTP take array types was cumbersome,
  since often you only had one part and had to wrap it up.  All methods that
  used to take a list of ServerPartTs now only take a single ServerPartT.  To
  convert your list of ServerPartT into a single ServerPartT, use msum.

  For example:
    simpleHTTP nullConf [spart1, spart2]
  Becomes:
    simpleHTTP nullConf $ msum [spart1, spart2]
  
  The functions affected by this change are:
    simpleHTTP, dir, path, anyPath, withData, withDataFn, require, requireM,
    xslt, debugFilter, applyRequest, basicAuth, and errorHandlerSP

  Gzip/Deflate encoding
  ------------------------------
  There is now a ServerPartT for gzip/deflate encoding, in
  Happstack.Server.Parts.compressedResponseFilter

  Guidlines for porting existing HAppS and Happstack <= 0.1 code to 0.2
  -------------------------------
  The first change you should do is change the following functions
  as described above.
    ServerPartT -> withRequest
    WebT -> mkWebT
    unServerPartT -> runServerPartT
    unWebT -> ununWebT
  
  Next, work on prepending $ msum in front of every list of ServerPartTs, or
  deleting lists that are no longer necessary.

  After this point, you should be able to get your app compiled and running.
  To further clean up your code and take advantage of the new functionality in
  ServerPartT, the general procedure is as follows:

  - consider studying the revised examples in happstack-server/Examples.  They
    all use the new idioms.
  
  - delete your type signatures that reference WebT or ServerPartT, as after
    the first step they will all have changed dramatically

  - delete all uses of withRequest and anyRequest (they aren't needed anymore)

  - change the idiom 'method m $' to 'methodM m >>'

  - change 'withRequest \rq -> do ...' to 'do { rq <- askRq; ... }'

  - change withData \myDat $ \dat -> do ... to
      do dat <- getData >>= maybe mzero return
         ... 
 
  - change withDataFn fn \myDat $ \dat -> do ... to
      do dat <- getDataFn fn >>= maybe mzero return
         ...

  - change all references of noHandle to mzero
  
  - you can probably benefit from some do blocks at this point

  - if you're passing around the request explictly, stop.  You can just
    "rq <- askRq" whenever you need it.

  - consider embedding your favorite monad transformer into your ServerPartTs.
    To make this work, you'll want to read the documentation for simpleHTTP',
    mapServerPartT, and WebT
  
  - consider reading the newly minted documentation for
    Happstack.Server.SimpleHTTP.  Hopefully you'll learn something.

  Windows Bin Path Caveats
  ------------------------------
  By default when you install say ghc 6.8.3 or 6.10.1, windows won't setup the paths.
  You need to perform these steps after running the installer for ghc:
    1. Right Click on "My Computer"
    2. Left Click on "Properties"
    3. Advanced Tab
    4. Environmental Variables
    5. Add or Edit existing 'PATH' variable
      If you have ghc 6.8.3 for instance:
        1. Prepend "C:\ghc\ghc-6.8.3;C:\ghc\ghc-6.8.3\bin;" to the Variable value
        2. Click OK
        3. Restart and cmd windows you have open
    6. Now all the commands should work i.e. ghci, ghc-pkg, perl etc.
