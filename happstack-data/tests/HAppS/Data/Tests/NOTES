stepcut:

I converted all the existing tests to use HUnit. Some of the tests
were failing before I did the conversion, I did not attempt to fix
them. Obviously we could change the tests so that they 'pass', but
that would be wrong if the failures actually indicated errors in
happstack-data.

There was not expected result listed for 'testPairs' so I guess that
the == assertion was supposed to hold when things are working.

Some of the Has* tests are specifically checking for the existence of
type errors which cause the compiler to fail. I have not ported these
tests yet. We can port them once we have the wrapper for calling
external programs in hunit.
