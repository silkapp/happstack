    Overlapping instances for HasT (Couple User t) t1
      arising from a use of `tHasT' at HasT003.hs:18:5-35
    Matching instances:
      instance [overlap ok] (HAppS.Data.HList.HasT' a b) => HasT a b
        -- Defined in HAppS.Data.HList
      instance [overlap ok] HasT (Couple a b) a
        -- Defined in HAppS.Data.HList
      instance [overlap ok] HasT (Couple a b) b
        -- Defined in HAppS.Data.HList
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of `t, t1'
     To pick the first instance above, use -fallow-incoherent-instances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: tHasT (User "alex" .&. 456) 123
    In the definition of `e9': e9 = tHasT (User "alex" .&. 456) 123
