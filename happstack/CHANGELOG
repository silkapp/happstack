Happstack 0.4
 * happstack-server: Added support for SendFile with an alternate constructor for 'Response'
       data Response  = Response  { rsCode      :: Int,
                                    rsHeaders   :: Headers,
                                    rsFlags     :: RsFlags,
                                    rsBody      :: L.ByteString,
                                    rsValidator :: Maybe (Response -> IO Response)
                                  }
                      | SendFile  { rsCode      :: Int,
                                    rsHeaders   :: Headers,
                                    rsFlags     :: RsFlags,
                                    rsValidator :: Maybe (Response -> IO Response),
                                    sfHandle    :: Handle,  -- file handle to send from
                                    sfOffset    :: Integer, -- offset to start at
                                    sfCount     :: Integer  -- number of bytes to send
                                  }
                      deriving (Show,Typeable) 
 * happstack-server: fileServe uses SendFile so the memory efficiency & performance should be much better
 * happstack-server: added guards 'host' and 'withHost' to SimpleHTTP
 * happstack-server: nuked Happstack.Server.S3 since other hackage libraries cover this functionality these days
Happstack 0.3
 * Modularization of the example application using the component system
 * All packages now require Cabal >= 1.6
 * Repository metadata added to cabal description
 * Moved Combined Logging from Happstack.Server to Happstack.Server.AccessLog.Combined

 * Fixes for some command-line browsers such as links
 * Guards now have fall-through semantics
 * Various updates & additions to documentation
 * Code beautification
 * Bugfix to Happstack.Util.Cron to accept intervals up to maxBound
 * addition of a strict version of fileServe "fileServeStrict"
 * fileServe (lazy) behaves more reliably now and escapes before any filters can be applied

Happstack 0.2
 * Module namespace refactoring from HAppS to Happstack
   HAppS.Server  -> Happstack.Server
   HAppS.State   -> Happstack.State
