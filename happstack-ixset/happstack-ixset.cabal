Name:                happstack-ixset
Version:             0.1.9
Synopsis:            Efficient relational queries on Haskell sets. 
Description:         Just pick which parts of your data structures you want indexed using an easy to use template-haskell function. Spare yourself the need to write, run, and maintain code that marshalls your data to/from an external relational database just for efficient queries. happstack-ixset relies on generics and TH to spare you the boilerplate normally required for such tasks.
