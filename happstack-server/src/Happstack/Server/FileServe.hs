-- * High-level functions for serving files


-- ** Serve a single file

-- | Serve a single, specified file. The name of the file being served is specified explicity. It is not derived automatically from the 'Request' url.
-- 
-- example 1:
-- 
--  Serve using sendfile() and the specified content-type
--
-- > serveFileUsing filePathSendFile (asContentType "image/jpeg") "/srv/data/image.jpg"
--
--
-- example 2:
-- 
--  Serve using a lazy ByteString and the guess the content-type from the extension
-- 
-- > serveFileUsing filePathLazy (guessContentTypeM mimeTypes) "/srv/data/image.jpg"
--

-- ** Serve files from a directory

-- | Serve files from a directory and its subdirectories (parameterizable version)
-- 
-- Parameterize this function to create functions like, 'fileServe', 'fileServeLazy', and 'fileServeStrict'
--
-- You supply:
--
--  1. a low-level function which takes a content-type and 'FilePath' and generates a Response
--
--  2. a function which determines the content-type from the 'FilePath'
--
--  3. a list of all the default index files
--
-- NOTE: unlike fileServe, there are no index files by default. See 'defaultIxFiles'.

-- | Serve files from a directory and its subdirectories using 'sendFile'.
-- 
-- Usage:
--
-- > fileServe ["index.html"] "path/to/files/on/disk"
--
-- Notes:
--
--  1. 'fileServe' does not support directory browsing. You should submit a patch!
--
--  2. The list of index files @[\"index.html\"]@ is only used to determine what file to show if the user requests a directory. You *do not* need to explicitly list all the files you want to serve.
