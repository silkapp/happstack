  S3 imposes a quite severe limitation on pipelined requests.
  Sending too many requests or exceeding a size limit will
  result in a disconnect. The precise borders of these limits
  are hard-wired and unknown to the general public. At the time
  of this writing, sending three requests at a time seems optimal.

  Quote from Amazons web-forum:
  (http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=39883)
  "OK, we have located the cause of the behavior you are seeing.
   Your pipelined requests are being aborted because one of the
   network devices handling the connection has certain limitations
   on the amount of pipelined data it is willing to accept per
   connection, and that limit is being exceeded. Unfortunately, this
   limit is phrased in very low-level terms so it isn't possible to
   say in a platform or network independent way whether any given
   size, sequence or number of requests will exceed the limit and
   cause a disconnection or not. We have engaged with the device
   vendor and found out that this limit is hard-wired and that this
   behavior is not likely to change any time soon.

   In light of these facts, here is some guidance on pipelining HTTP
   requests to Amazon S3.
    1) Be optimistic and pipeline a modest number of GET or HEAD
       requests, say two to four.
    2) Handle asynchronous disconnects by re-connecting and re-sending
       unacknowledged requests left in your pipeline. (As Colin points
       out, correct HTTP clients must do this anyway)
    3) If possible, try to minimize the number of TCP segments your
       pipelined requests generate. In particular, leave the TCP socket
       no delay option off and send as many requests per socket write call
       as is practical."
